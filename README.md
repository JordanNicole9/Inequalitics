# Project Title: Inequalitics: A Multivariable Shiny Dashboard Exploring the Relationship Between Income Inequality and Democratic Resilience

# This project explores the relationship between income inequality and the strength of democratic institutions across a sample of nineteen countries from 2012 to 2023. Using publicly available data sets from the World Inequality Database (Top 10% income share), the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) data set, and the Freedom House Index, the project cleans, merges, and analyzes multiyear data to uncover patterns between wealth concentration and indicators of democratic health. A k-means clustering model with three clusters was developed externally to classify countries as Stable, At Risk, or Backsliding based on four scaled variables. These include top 10 percent income share, electoral democracy index (v2x_polyarchy), freedom of expression (v2x_freexp_altinf), and political participation (v2x_partip).

# The research question guiding this project is: How does income inequality correlate with democratic resilience over time, and how do country-level patterns cluster in terms of risk to democratic institutions? To explore this question interactively, a Shiny web application was developed with a clean, fluid layout and five reactive widgets. The user can explore a line plot of income concentration trends for one country, bar charts of average V-Dem variables across countries, boxplots and bar charts from Freedom House variables, and an area or line graph comparing income inequality trends across selected countries. The app includes a reset button to return all widgets to their default states. All visualizations were styled using color palettes and minimal themes for accessibility and clarity.

# The data preparation involved extensive cleaning of each source file, renaming columns for consistency, filtering by country and year, and merging the three data sets into a unified structure. The final data set included variables required for both the visualizations and the external clustering model. Z-score standardization was applied prior to k-means clustering, and silhouette analysis was used to evaluate cluster quality. The resulting assignments were saved to a file used for further analysis and visualization.

# This project demonstrates how openly available indicators can be combined to explore complex questions about democracy and inequality. Key findings suggest that higher income concentration is often associated with declining scores on democratic measures, and countries classified as At Risk or Backsliding tend to display more volatility over time. For example, Colombia and Brazil showed signs of backsliding, while countries like Sweden and Finland remained stable across all indicators.

# The following files are included in the project directory: app.R (which contains the complete R script for data processing, clustering, and the Shiny interface), V-Dem-CY-Full+Others-v15.csv, All_data_FIW_2013-2024.xlsx, income.highest.10.csv, and clustered_output.csv. These files are required to run the application locally. To run the app, users must install R and RStudio, load the required R packages, and place the data files in the same directory as the app.R file. Launching the app can be done directly from RStudio using the "Run App" button.
